# Game of Life by Etienne Goury CDOF2

This project is a Python implementation of the Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. In this console-based version, spaces represent dead cells, and '#' symbols represent live cells, offering an intuitive visualization of the game's evolution over time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow the deployment notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need Python installed on your system. Python 3.x versions are recommended. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Verify the installation by running:
`python --version`

### Installing

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Game-of-life-EtienneGoury-CDOF2.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Game-of-life-EtienneGoury-CDOF2
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```
    python game_of_life.py
    ```

Now, the Game of Life should be running in your console.

## Deployment

This is a console-based application and is intended to be run locally. Deployment beyond a local environment is not supported in the current version.
